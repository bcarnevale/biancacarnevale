                    I am a junior developer currently residing in Melbourne, Australia. <br>
                    From August, 2018, I began my journey at the Coder Academy Bootcamp. <br>
                    Prior to entering the tech industry, I studied Civil Engineering, Economics and Marketing in Perth where I am from. <br>
                    I have worked as a Junior Producer and an Account Manager in Digital Marketing with a focus on SEO.

                    Somewhere in between, I lived and worked in Austin, Texas and explored many corners of the USA. <br>
                    Head to state-affair.com to check out just a few of my adventures. <br>
                    Other than the above, I fill my time with friends, family, hikes, painting, sewing, music shows and am always willing to try out something new!
